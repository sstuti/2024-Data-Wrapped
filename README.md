# 2024 Data Wrapped 📊

This project contains data analysis and visualization using data and statistics from the year 2024, hence the name "2024 Data Wrapped". The data has been collected by scraping online sources using Python's Beautiful Soup library, and the visualizations have been created using R.

I am also actively posting new graphs and analyses on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sstutidmehra/), so give me a follow! I would love to connect and discuss the visualizations!

## Graphs + Analyses

I will constantly be updating this section as I develop new visualizations.

### Hierarchical Treemaps on Revenues vs Market Capitalization for the Fortune Top 50 Companies

<img src="images/revenue_treemap.png" width="350"/>

Market capitalization (valuation) reflects the investors’ confidence in the growth potential, and investors put their money where they anticipate maximum growth\
\
Looking at the figures below:\
• While the Energy sector leads with the largest revenue, the Tech industry dominates market cap\
• Tech companies have huge valuations relative to their revenues, indicated by the large skew we see in the second treemap\
• Financial firms are balanced between their revenue generation and market cap
